Project 1 Readme File

This project is (hopefully) a functional, fully working program that can create 
2-dimensional points of any size and perform various actions with said points.

By creating a Class within the program that creates an array of multiple 2D points, the 
user should be able to add and print the sums of points (integers or doubles), 
copy sequences of points, move sequences of points, and best of all, print those 
sequences however they see fit.

This was only made possible by overloading certain key features within the program, such
as <<. >>, +, and =.  By changing the behaviors of these operators, the user should be
able to use these operations on created objects in the program as though they were 
simple integers or strings.
